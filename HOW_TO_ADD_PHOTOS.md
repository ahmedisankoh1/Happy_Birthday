# 🎂 How to Add Photos to Your Mum's Birthday Website

## Quick Start Guide

1. **Collect 6 photos** of your mum (or you can start with fewer and add more later)

2. **Rename your photos** to these exact names:
   - `hero-image.jpg` - Main photo of your mum (shows at the top)
   - `gentle-heart.jpg` - Photo showing her gentle/caring nature
   - `kitchen-queen.jpg` - Photo of her cooking or in the kitchen
   - `big-heart.jpg` - Photo showing her kindness or helping others
   - `us-together.jpg` - Photo of you and your mum together
   - `birthday-wish.jpg` - Special birthday or happy moment photo

3. **Copy the renamed photos** into the `images` folder

4. **Open the website** - the photos will automatically appear!

## Important Notes:
- If a photo is missing, a placeholder will show with instructions
- Photos should be JPG or PNG format
- Keep file sizes under 1MB for faster mobile loading
- Square photos work best, but any format will work
- The website automatically crops photos to fit perfectly

- Recent photos usually work best

That's it! Your mum will love seeing these personal photos in her birthday surprise! 💖
